I used variables and if/else if statements to determine proper responses to user input values in the prompts that the code initiates.

This assignment took me a while, a long while.
I was unsure which documents required what info at first and I had a tough time remembering exactly what steps I needed to do in order to push this local git repo into the cloud repo (I am still unclear on terminology at the moment).
  I created the first template for the first question in the app.js file and then copied templates but with slightly different variations to see if they would still work and to keep my memory of the different ways to make this code work expanded.
Overall, at the end of the day, I still feel a little intimidated by the whole assignment when starting from scratch, but I find as I progress further and further through each project, I am able to become more confident in my abilities to code and retain the information I dish out.

As the driver I add function to all question and in addition we also fixed some bug in question 6 and 7.
